  <h2>Various Educational Math Resources</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, I graduated from Amherst College in 2022 with a degree in math and
    a strong interest in teaching. Over the years, I wrote a bunch of documents
    on assorted undergraduate math topics, the most extensive being a "mini-textbook"
    about branches of complex functions and integration. I hope people will find
    these resources helpful for their own math learning. If you notice any errors,
    feel free to email me at wtseng9@gmail.com.

    Enjoy!
